# editor

A personal terminal text editor for Linux, written in C23.

It targets Wayland and the foot, alacritty and ghostty terminals, and requires the Kitty Keyboard Protocol. There is no fallback for legacy terminals.

> Status: early development (milestone M0, skeleton and build). The editor does not do anything useful yet.

## Build

```sh
./build.sh           # optimised build, produces ./editor
./build.sh --debug   # unoptimised build with address and undefined behaviour sanitizers
```

Requirements: gcc 15 or newer (for C23 `#embed`), bash, and `wl-clipboard` at runtime for system clipboard support.

The build compiles the vendored tree-sitter sources once into `build/vendor` and only recompiles them when they change. The editor sources are rebuilt every time. The build fails if `data/words.txt` is not sorted in byte order.

## Usage

```sh
editor                       # new empty buffer
editor file                  # open file (created on first save if it does not exist)
editor file1 path/to/file2   # load both and pick one
editor folder                # load every file under folder and pick one
```

Key bindings will be documented here as features land.
